# leaflet-challenge

In this project, I developed a visualization for USGS earthquake data that will allow this government organization to better educate the public and other egencies on geoligical issues that our planet is facing. This tool could potentially lead to further secured funding for the USGS--which is the agency responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the impacts of climate and land-use change, and the health of our ecosystems and evnironment as a whole. 

The workflow for the project is as follows:

Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization

Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data (Optional)

Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization 2-BasicMap
